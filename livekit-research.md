# LiveKit Research

## LiveKit Fundamentals

LiveKit is an open source platform for building realtime media applications. It provides infrastructure for integrating audio, video, text, data, and AI models, built on top of WebRTC.

### Core Components

- **LiveKit Server**: An open-source media server enabling realtime communication between participants
- **LiveKit SDKs**: Web, native, and backend SDKs for joining rooms and publishing/consuming media
- **LiveKit Agents**: Framework for building realtime multimodal AI agents
- **Telephony**: SIP integration for calling into LiveKit rooms or agent sessions
- **Egress**: Recording and exporting media from LiveKit rooms
- **Ingress**: Ingesting external streams (RTMP, WHIP) into LiveKit rooms
- **Server APIs**: REST API for room management with SDKs and CLI

### Deployment Options

1. **LiveKit Cloud**: Fully-managed, globally distributed service
2. **Self-hosted**: Run the open source LiveKit server on your own infrastructure

### Key Advantages

- Developer-friendly APIs across platforms
- Open source with no vendor lock-in
- AI-native with first-class support for AI models
- Scalable from a few users to thousands of concurrent participants
- Deployment flexibility (cloud or self-hosted)
- Private and secure with end-to-end encryption
- Built on WebRTC for optimal performance

Next, I need to research LiveKit Workers specifically to understand how they work for our application.
